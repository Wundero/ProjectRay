  "body": "# Ray  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Wundero/Ray.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Wundero/Ray)\r\nRay is an open source chat management system built for Sponge.\r\n\r\nDownload: [__[Here]__](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/releases)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nThis plugin requires SpongeAPI version 5.X or newer.\r\n# Features\r\nThis plugin allows you to completely control the formatting of chat messages.\r\n## Groups\r\nThis plugin uses \"groups\" to section users off into separate, permission based format selections. Each group has an optional permission and priority; the groups with the highest number for priority will be chosen over lower numbers. Each user will automatically be assigned a group based on their highest priority permitted group.\r\n## Formats\r\nEach group contains \"formats\", which are what handle text replacement in messages. Each format is backed by json based text, which replaces variables and parses json.\r\n\r\nTo create formats, it is __highly__ recommended to use the in-game format builder rather than editing the config, as it will prevent errors and other problems.\r\n\r\n__View information about formats [[Here]](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/wiki/Formats)__\r\n\r\nFormats are split in two ways: Types and Contexts.\r\n### Format Types\r\nFormat types are how the format is displayed; for instance, an animation displaying consecutive frames. Several types store internal format(s), which can be any type too. You can have an event format which triggers an animated format with multi formats containing translatables.\r\n\r\n__View information about format types [[Here]](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/wiki/Format-Types).__\r\n### Format contexts\r\nFormat contexts are when and where the format is displayed; for instance, when players send chat messages. The plugin by default comes with several contexts built in.\r\n\r\n__View information about format contexts [[Here]](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/wiki/Format-contexts).__\r\n## Channels\r\nThis plugin also has internal support for customizable ChatChannels, which are customizable and have an in-game builder.\r\n\r\n__View information about channels [[Here]](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/wiki/Channels).__\r\n## Tags\r\nTags are a generic \"button\" that can be used in chat to create dynamic effects. There are several types of tags included in the plugin.\r\n\r\n__View information about tags [[Here]](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/wiki/Tags).__\r\n\r\n### Extras\r\nDownload: [__[Here]__](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/releases)\r\n\r\nSource: [__[Here]__](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/)\r\n\r\nWiki: [__[Here]__](https://github.com/Wundero/Ray/wiki)\r\n",
