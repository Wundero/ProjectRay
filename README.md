# ProjectRay
Open Source chat manager


TODO

- death messages
- fix ranged obfuscation (and make numbers bigger)
- more format types (See FormatType.java for details)
- nicknames
- fully fledged permission system (not sure how to work this into the current setup though)
- displayname changing (prefix/suffix/name/other tags or whatever)
- different chat levels (i.e. shout/talk/whisper)
- spy
- program that nicely allows config editing (config looks like garbage but I can't fix that)
- bungee support (prolly through something other than bungee's system, such as sockets, but meh)
- chat filter
- urls in chat
- hooks to other sponge plugins
- economy?
- tags and other customizable clickable things (like buttons)
- proper logging (to console and file)
- sql/nosql database? (probably sql) - for server synching
- DOCUMENTATION (and javadocs)
- clearing chat
- first join (new server) groups null - IMPORTANT TO FIX THIS
- translation files
- fake messages
- message editor/remover/adder (only considering since it consumes more memory than i think i would like)
  - might make this as a mod addon instead
- mail (only considering since i would have to deal with offline variables and i don't want to)
  - perhaps for mail i could serialize and store the map of info for the sender and then when read parse for recipient too?
- api
- more config templates
- more default generated args

more that i can't think of right now
