# ProjectRay
Open Source chat manager


TODO

- death messages
- animations
- chat channels (loading and assigning)
- translation files
- fake messages
- message editor/remover/adder (only considering since it consumes more memory than i think i would like)
- mail (only considering since i would have to deal with offline variables and i don't want to)
  - perhaps for mail i could serialize and store the map of info for the sender and then when read parse for recipient too?
- api
- more config templates
- more default generated args
- chat channel conversation
- extract conversation into separate project?

more that i can't think of right now
