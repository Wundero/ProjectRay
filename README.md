# ProjectRay
Open Source server manager

This plugin is meant to be an all in one controller for servers looking to unify their data.
This is under heavy development and is NOT FUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT.

Things to do:
-Full permissions support (groups, global groups, mirroring, inheritance, the likes)
-Full chat support
-Implementations in Sponge and Bukkit
-Remove most dependencies (Such as protocollib and vault) and make them soft dependencies
-Default packages (easy to setup and use, premade downloadable settings made to work immediately)
-Converters (from permissions and chat plugins to copy old formats and update them to current settings)
-Command architecture that actually works
-Performance monitor for the plugin
-Translation support for in-built messages (no chat translation as that is unreliable)
-Potentially go towards full control over server messages (bossbar/scoreboard/actionbar/title/tablist/etc.)
-Potentially make animations (only if above is achieved)
-PlaceholderAPI support
-BungeeCord and RedisBungee (and sponge alternatives) support
-Database support for multiple types of db's (sql, redis, etc)
-Potentially make a GUI system for commands built into the architecture, and disable by default (interface?)
-Changeable name (final name for this plugin is probably not going to be ProjectRay but whatever)
